# Autonomous-vehicle-level3
The below task 1,2,3 files need to be run in MATLAB to simulate the vehicle using the simulink model Lanemaintain system.
THe lanemaintainsytem_edit simulink is modified simulink model that should be used to make sure that the braking system of CarB works as expected. which means that CarB puts the right amout of gain on the force and calculates the distance between the Cars A and B.
